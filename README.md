# ZoomTube

If you would like to discretely browse youtube or watch a video while at work but make it seem like you are doing something useful, just open ZoomTube and enjoy your videos in peace while the rest of the office assumes you are on a zoom call.

## How to use

- Edit the display names of your and the video's titles from the participants side bar as well.
- Select the Chat icon in the bottom row to browse the selected Youtube video's comments (obviously only available if that particular youtube video has comments enabled)
- The blue menu icon in the corner of the video and your displays on the main page provide options to rename / hide / or quick remove the youtube video.
- The Leave button in the bottom right immediately removes the youtube video.
